## Data manipulation in R lecture

This presentation on `dplyr` was originally generated for Trevor Branch's Super Advanced R class, and was updated for a lab meeting at Rutgers. The repository can also serve as an example of using `knitr` to produce a beamer presentation with embedded R code. I am also using this repository to practice using git, so beware.

The presentation pdf is meant to go alongside data_manip_R_lect.R. There is also a file with (possible) solutions to the exercises.
